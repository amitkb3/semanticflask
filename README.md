LearnWorld is app which enables children to learn and pronounce concepts in Hindi and English
# LearnWorld Capstone

The LearnWorld API is app which enables children to learn and pronounce concepts in Hindi and English.
This api is responsible for showing lessons and associated cards for learning. Also checks permissions and provides CRUD capabilities for Lesson and Card Models.

## Motivation

This is my capstone project for the Udacity FSWD nanodegree.

## Getting Started

## Authentication

The API has three roles:

1. Public

 - Can access lessons and cards without authentications

 ```
 No authentication required
 permissions: `get:lessons`,`get:cards`
 ```

2. Developer

Can create and edit lessons and cards but cannot delete them.

```
email: developer@learnworld.com
password: developer@learnworld.com1
permissions: `get:lessons`,`get:cards`,`post:lessons`,`post:cards`,`patch:lessons`,`patch:cards`
```

3. Admin

Can perform all CURD operations.

```
email: admin@learnworld.com
password: admin@learnworld.com1
permissions: `get:lessons`,`get:cards`,`post:lessons`,`post:cards`,`patch:lessons`,`patch:cards`,`delete:lessons`,`delete:cards`
```

3. Producer

```
email: producer@casting.com
password: producer@casting.com1
```

The Auth0 domain and api audience can be found in `setup.sh`.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the root directory of this project and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

After installing the dependencies, execute the bash file `setup.sh` to set the user jwts, auth0 credentials and the remote database url by naviging to the root directory of this project and running:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

## Running the server

From within the root directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `app.py` directs flask to use the `app.py` file to find the application.

## Testing

#### Testing remote server using postman

- Import the postman collection `./learnworld.postman_collection.json`.
  - This collection has 3 roles that have specific permissions detailed below.
  - Roles
    - Public
      - `get:lessons`,`get:cards`
    - Developer
      - `get:lessons`,`get:cards`,`post:lessons`,`post:cards`,`patch:lessons`,`patch:cards`
    - Admin (all permissions)
      - `get:lessons`,`get:cards`,`post:lessons`,`post:cards`,`patch:lessons`,`patch:cards`,`delete:lessons`,`delete:cards`
    
- Once imported, Run the collection and play around with the endpoints within folders `public`, `developer` and `admin`.

#### Running tests locally
To run the tests from ./test_app.py, first make sure you have ran and executed the setup.sh file to set the enviorment.

After setting the enviorment start your local postgress server:
```bash
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
```

Then run the follwing commands to run the tests:
```
dropdb learnworld_test
createdb learnworld_test
psql learnworld_test < learnworld_test.psql
python test_app.py
```
